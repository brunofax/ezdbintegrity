. verify if there are more FKs than the ones we know about / some of the current ones to tweak

. add a module/view to display violations in GUI

. add per-ez-version inis and load those instead of generic one

. allow php scripts to run even if extension is not activated (see how autoload is handled in ggsysinfo)

. create a php class that loops on FK defs and actually creates them in the db

. allow reading of schema constraints from various file formats (.dba but also schemaspy etc)
  + also write them

. check for violations of constraints on existing (published versions) data:
  + mandatory attributes
  + string length violations
  + options violations
  + etc...

. check for clustering violations:
  + in mysql ezdb, master vs. slave table
  + in ezdfs, table vs. filesystem (nb: already done in recent eZ versions?)
