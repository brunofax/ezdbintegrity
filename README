eZ DB Integrity Extension for eZ publish
========================================

Goals:
------

Allows checking integrity of data in a database (the eZ Publish one, but any other as well).


Current checks supported:
-------------------------

1. FK integrity

   This applies to databases with no FK enabled, but where parent-child relationships do in fact exist


How to use it:
--------------

- run extension/ezdbintegrity/bin/checkschema.php --help to get started

- you can define more FKs to check in ezdbintegrity.ini.append.php


DISCLAIMER
----------

!!! DO NOT BLINDLY DELETE ANY DATA IN THE DB WHICH IS REPORTED AS FOREIGN KEY VIOLATION !!!

We take no responsibility for consequences if you do.
You should carefully investigate the reason for such violations.
There is a good chance that the problem lies within this extension and not your data - the FK definitions provided
have been reverse-engineered from existing codebase and databases, and are not cast in stone.
