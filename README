eZ DB Integrity Extension for eZ publish
========================================

Goals:
------

Allows checking integrity of data in a database (the eZ Publish one, but any other as well).


Current checks supported:
-------------------------

1. Foreign Key integrity

   This applies to databases which have no FK enabled, but where parent-child relationships do in fact exist.
   The relationships to check are defined via configuration files.
   The standard configuration has FK definitions for the eZPublish schema (versions 4.x => 5.2)

2. Content Objects integrity

   This checks eZPublish Content Objects, validating every attribute based on its datatype definition.
   F.e. it checks if attributes are null which should not be, or if image files are missing.
   NB: not all datatypes are supported for now, just a limited set

How to use it:
--------------

- run "php extension/ezdbintegrity/bin/php/checkschema.php --help" and "php extension/ezdbintegrity/bin/php/checkattributes.php --help" to get started

- you can define more FKs and attribute types to be checked, in ezdbintegrity.ini.append.php


DISCLAIMER
----------

!!! DO NOT BLINDLY DELETE ANY DATA IN THE DB WHICH IS REPORTED AS FOREIGN KEY VIOLATION !!!

We take no responsibility for consequences if you do.
You should carefully investigate the reason for such violations.
There is a good chance that the problem lies within this extension and not your data - the FK definitions provided
have been reverse-engineered from existing codebase and databases, and are not cast in stone.
